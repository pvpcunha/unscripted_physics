## Unscripted Physics
*Explorations in physics, modeling, and curiosity*
<br>

<img src="images/img.png" alt="Sample" width="300px">

Hi, and welcome to my website! 


I have created this space to share ideas, models, and rough explorations that don't always fit neatly into scientific articles or proposals. Some are just things I was curious about. This is a collection of informal, yet serious, reflections and analyses driven by curiosity, mostly grounded in physics and math, and always shaped by the desire to understand the world a little better.

At the heart of it is a love for modeling:  using simple principles to break down complex systems from our world into something more manageable, to get a better grasp on how things actually work.

You can navigate the website and its contents using the menu above.

The content here is not peer-reviewed and does not aim to be final. Some of it explores rough models or back-of-the-envelope estimates, or just rethinks problems just for the joy of it. Think of it as thoughtful sketchbook made public.

If something here proves useful in your work, in your teaching or research - or if you have just any comments - feel free to reach out by email (**pvcunha@ua.pt**). If you end up using or building upon any of this material, I only ask that you give appropriate credit.

Thanks for reading.
